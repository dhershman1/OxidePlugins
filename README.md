# OxidePlugins by KillParadise
Welcome to my plugins GitHub! Before you download you should know:
>All my plugins are written via JavaScript
I just like it that way.

I am hoping to move to python as well so both python and js will be on my plugins. Thank you for stopping by! and I love to hear comments or suggestions on my plugins. So please share your thoughts. 

##Current Plans

Currently I want to make a series of plugins to interact and work well together such as bountyboard and transit systems. Maybe even a RPG support API in the future. my main projects are BountyBoard, and Ranks plugins. But I tend to bounce around a bit here and there. Hoping to have more plugins in the near future. 

##Looking for help or to learn

If you're looking to learn the oxide from a JS end point, I am happy to help anyone with questions. Feel free to use my plugins as guides but they are constantly changing as I figure more efficient blocks of code. All I ask in return is a little bit of recognition. I understand most of the other languages basics, but JavaScript is my strong point. Feel free to message me anytime, I will try my best to get back to you ASAP.

##Now Supporting RoK

Reign of Kings is now going to be a project supported by my plugin series. Hopefully soon new plugins can be pushed to see what we can make! Leave me ideas!

##Support

I now am using the github issue tracker to support issues, and suggestions! So please post them here:
