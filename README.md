# OxidePlugins by KillParadise (Unstable Branch)
Welcome to the unstable branch! 
#####Warning: These are UNSTABLE for a reason! They are untested! Or contain new code, new styles, new anything! Use at your own risk!

##Current Policy
All Plugins are free to use and you can use them in your servers at your pleasure. All plugins are editable, and you can use them as examples in any of your own plugins. I just ask for a slight bit of credit if you do! Thanks!

##Looking for help or to learn

If you're looking to learn the oxide from a JS end point, I am happy to help anyone with questions. Feel free to use my plugins as guides but they are constantly changing as I figure more efficient blocks of code. All I ask in return is a little bit of recognition. I understand most of the other languages basics, but JavaScript is my strong point. Feel free to message me anytime, I will try my best to get back to you ASAP.

##Now Supporting RoK

Reign of Kings is now going to be a project supported by my plugin series. Hopefully soon new plugins can be pushed to see what we can make! Leave me ideas!

##Support

I now am using the github issue tracker to support issues, and suggestions! So please post them here:
