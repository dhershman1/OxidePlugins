# OxidePlugins by KillParadise
Welcome to my plugins GitHub! Before you download you should know:
>All my plugins are written via JavaScript
I just like it that way.

##Current Policy
All Plugins are free to use and you can use them in your servers at your pleasure. All plugins are editable, and you can use them as examples in any of your own plugins. I just ask for a slight bit of credit if you do! Thanks!

##Branch
You should be using the master branch for the latest up to date plugins and their code.

##Looking for help or to learn

If you're looking to learn the oxide from a JS end point, I am happy to help anyone with questions. Feel free to use my plugins as guides but they are constantly changing as I figure more efficient blocks of code. All I ask in return is a little bit of recognition. I understand most of the other languages basics, but JavaScript is my strong point. Feel free to message me anytime, I will try my best to get back to you ASAP.

##Support

I now am using the github issue tracker to support issues, and suggestions! So please post them here:
