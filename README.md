# OxidePlugins by KillParadise
Welcome to my plugins GitHub! Before you download you should know:
>All my plugins are written via JavaScript
I just like it that way.

I am hoping to move to python as well so both python and js will be on my plugins. Thank you for stopping by! and I love to hear comments or suggestions on my plugins. So please share your thoughts. 

##Current Plans

My current plan is to make a plugin system with each one I plan to release which eventually will all work together, in order to create one large system for servers. This system is called the "Faction and Territory System" you can check out a mind map for what I am currently Planning here: [Plugin Mind Map](http://mind42.com/public/c5d7c691-5155-4cf2-a556-8be1d1ea2de4 "Mind Map")
