# OxidePlugins by KillParadise
Welcome to my plugins GitHub! Before you download you should know:
>All my plugins are written via JavaScript
I just like it that way.

I am hoping to move to python as well so both python and js will be on my plugins. Thank you for stopping by! and I love to hear comments or suggestions on my plugins. So please share. 

You can find my oxide list here: [Oxide Resources for KillParadise](http://forum.rustoxide.com/resources/authors/killparadise.49026/ "My Oxide Resources")
