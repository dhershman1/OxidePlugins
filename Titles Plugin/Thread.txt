Welcome to ranks and Titles! With this plugin you can setup an automated customized ranking system, or would you rather use a custom titles system for donors, staff, veterans, etc? You're in the right place!

[B][U]PLEASE READ[/U][/B] through this post the plugin requires a setup (real quick and easy) that will get data going correctly (Must be done or else the plugin will error and you will not get ranks or titles)

[B][U]How do I Start?[/U][/B]
I'm glad you asked! here's how it works:
[LIST]
[*]Install The plugin the usual way
[*]In your server type /setup or /setup info (there are info prompts that explain both systems)
[*]type /setup ranks or /setup titles to choose which system you wish to use
[*]you will be given one more command based on the system you choose to finish setup
[*]Thats it! the plugin will then handle everything else for you.
[/LIST]
[B][U]Ranks[/U][/B]
Ranks works like it sounds, its a ranking system, which is kill based there is a Kill and Death counter for each player along with a rank system that they can progress through, you can make this as long as you want or as short as you wish the plugin is 100% config dynamic
(Please check the FAQ on how to add ranks to your config)
[B][U]Titles[/U][/B]
Titles is a system thats a more laid back Admin ran system, the admin can set custom titles for players such as Donor, VIP, Veteran, etc. you can also change basic ones like Admin, Mod, and Player (these are auto set for you so dont think you have to give each new player a title when they join the plugin will handle that) Once you give someone a custom title the plugin will remember it, so no need to set it every time.
