[B][U]How To Add Custom Ranks[/U][/B]
Copy and Paste one of the current ranks as it is like so:
[code=javascript]
{
      "rank": 0.0,
      "title": "New Guy",
      "killsNeeded": 0.0
    }
[/code]
Now paste it and update your values:
[code=javascript]
{
      "rank": 1.0,
      "title": "That Dude",
      "killsNeeded": 5.0
    }
[/code]
And that's it! the plugin will now use this rank when a player hits 5 kills!

[B][U]How To Add Custom Titles[/U][/B]
Copy and Paste one of the current titles as it is like so:
[code=javascript]
{
      "authLvl": 2.0,
      "title": "Owner",
      "Exclude": true
    }
[/code]
Now paste it and update your values:
[code=javascript]
{
      "authLvl": 2.0,
      "title": "Best Owner",
      "Exclude": true
    }
[/code]
What does Exclude mean? Well this is a current config setting for when I introduce hiding entire titles rather than just certain ones. right now I would leave it as true.
